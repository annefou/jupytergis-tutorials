# Introduction

JupyterGIS is a JupyterLab extension designed for collaborative Geographical Information System (GIS) projects. It empowers multiple users to work together in real-time on geospatial tasks, fostering seamless collaboration on map layers, spatial analyses, and GIS data development.

Key features include support for QGIS project files, enabling smooth import and export between QGIS and JupyterLab while preserving styles, data sources, and settings. Beyond this compatibility, JupyterGIS offers tools for editing, visualizing, and analyzing spatial data collaboratively within JupyterLab, along with options for sharing map layers and annotating directly in the environment.

For Python enthusiasts, JupyterGIS integrates effortlessly with geospatial libraries like GeoPandas, Xarray, and Rasterio, allowing advanced analyses and process automation. With its robust capabilities, JupyterGIS bridges the gap between desktop GIS tools and collaborative, cloud-based workflows.
