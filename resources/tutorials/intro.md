# Getting Started with JupyterGIS

Welcome to the first tutorial in the JupyterGIS series! This guide will introduce you to the basics of JupyterGIS and help you set up your environment, create your first map, and understand its key features.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand what JupyterGIS is and its key capabilities.
2. Set up the required tools and libraries.
3. Create a simple map and add layers.
4. Explore basic geospatial analysis using JupyterGIS.


## Introduction to JupyterGIS

JupyterGIS integrates geospatial analysis with the interactivity of Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to:

- Visualize and create interactive maps.
- Process and analyze geospatial data.
- Share and collaborate on geospatial workflows.

JupyterGIS is designed for researchers, data scientists, and GIS professionals aiming to combine Pythonâ€™s analytical power with intuitive geospatial visualizations.
